calculate_modes_flexible
                        Calculate modes with the AMS3D algorithm for a
                        lidar point cloud of a forest
extract_coordinate_values
                        Extract coordinate data from an object
segment_tree_crowns     Segment Tree Crowns in a 3D Point Cloud
segment_tree_crowns_core
                        Calls the C++ back-end and the DBSCAN algorithm
                        to perform the segmentation
validate_scale_n_offset_are_consistent
                        Asserts that all files referenced by a
                        LAScatalog have the same scale and offset
                        values.
validate_write_crown_id_also_to_file_for_LAScatalogs
                        Ensures that crown IDs are written to output
                        files of the LAScatalog
