/** \brief Contains an implementation of the mean shift algorithm adapted for
 *  the use case of identifying tree crowns in 3D LiDAR point clouds as
 *  described by Ferraz et. al 2012.
 *
 *  \par
 *  ams3d is short for "3D adaptive mean shift algorithm", a term used in Ferraz
 *  et. al 2016.
 *
 *  \par How it works
 *  The algorithm tries to find the mode, i.e. kind of the location of the tree
 *  crown for each point in the point cloud. It does this by following the steps
 *  below for each point:
 *
 *  1. It constructs a so called kernel, i.e. a space with the shape of a
 *  vertical cylinder with the point at it's center.
 *  2. The lower quarter of the kernel is truncated.
 *  3. All points in the point cloud that intersect with the truncated kernel
 *  are collected.
 *  4. A weighted centroid is calculated for the collected points, weighted
 *  meaning here that points that are closer to the kernel's center get a higher
 *  weight. There are two different weight functions. One for the points'
 *  horizontal distance to the kernel's center and one for the points' vertical
 *  distance to that center.
 *  5. Now a new kernel is constructed around the calculated centroid.
 *  6. Steps 2 to 5 are repeated until consecutive centroids converge, i.e. when
 *  the distance between consecutive centroids gets smaller than a certain
 *  threshold.
 *  7. The centroid calculated last is then treated as the original point's
 *  mode.
 *
 *  It has been observed that the modes of points that belong to the same tree
 *  crown cluster shortly below the crown apex. In order to assign crown IDs to
 *  points, these clusters have to be identified with another algorithm, e.g.
 *  DBSCAN.
 *
 *
 *  \par On Compliance with the Equations Published by Ferraz et. al 2012
 *  The equations in Ferraz et. al assume a symmetric kernel with a point of
 *  the point cloud as it's center. For calculating the kernel's centroid,
 *  equations (13) and (14) are designed in such a way that points in the
 *  kernel's lower quarter are ignored.
 *      This implementation deviates from those equations in that it
 *  uses kernel objects that directly model the upper three quarters of a
 *  symmetric kernel. The respective equations are modified accordingly.
 *      The calculation of point weights on the kernel's vertical profile also
 *  differs from equations (13) and (14) in Ferraz et. al. In equation (13) the
 *  calculation of a point's vertical distance to the kernel's boundary is shown
 *  together with  the normalization of that distance. This relative distance is
 *  then subtracted from one in equation (14), which effectively inverts it to
 *  the relative distance to the kernel's center.
 *      In this implementation the relative vertical distance to the kernel's
 *  center is calculated directly.
 *      Also when passing relative distances to the Gaussian and Epanechnikov
 *  functions some redundant calculations were omitted. I.e. calculating
 *  distances requires to square values and then take the square root of them.
 *  However, since the profile functions square their arguments anyways, the
 *  distance calculations directly pass squared values to the Gaussian and
 *  Epanechnikov functions.
